  - playtest:
    - graph:
      - track income, not cities


    - when you kill all cities it says you killed airbases
    - could have defensive building gen scale with player gen
    - default selection for B52 (and hotkey)
    - allow resignation


  - lobby
    - editing config from lobby for game speed, starting resources, buildings, gen
    - don't allow creating another game unless you leave your current


  - refactor:
    - selectors are copypastad between server and client
    - getPlaneDesignsByGen should take in game (on both server and client)



  - CPU opponent:
    - UI for selecting AI opponent
    - server state for AI opponent
    - randomized AI plane designs and deployments
    - randomized AI daemon for launching planes


  - maybe features
    - planes have to refit before they can launch again
    - try out rollback netcode
