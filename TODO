  - playtest:
    - no indicator that planes are queued that aren't producing yet
    - having your last airbase destroyed kills all your planes returning to base


  - Algorithms:
    - intercept target for fighters
    - one fighter per bomber (don't target things that are already targeted)


  - UI:
    - factory UI showing production queue
    - research UI showing status and start/pause


  - refactor:
    - selectors are copypastad between server and client
    - getPlaneDesignsByGen should take in game (on both server and client)


  - balance
    - more expensive planes just take longer to make...


  - potentially degenerate strategies:
    - rush down cities --> different loss conditions?
    - using faster bombers to lead fighters until they're out of fuel
    - only make 1 B52 and tons of fighters for infinite fuel
    - defending with TU-16s which draw off fighters
    - building tons of cities before opponent planes can even reach you


  - CPU opponent:
    - UI for selecting AI opponent
    - server state for AI opponent
    - randomized AI plane designs and deployments
    - randomized AI daemon for launching planes


  - additional features:
    - try out rollback netcode


  - maybe features
    - planes have to refit before they can launch again
