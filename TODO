  - refactors:
    - removed all plane designer constraints from config
    - adding starting airbases, cities, factories, labs, to config
    - type: fighter/bomber/recon -> plane with isFighter, isBomber types
    - add planeCapacity property to denote things that are carriers, planeTypes to restrict which ones
    - dogfightings
      - add gen bonus for dogfights
      - isDogfighter that can defend itself but doesn't seek out fighters
      - isDrone that doesn't return to base and dies on contact
    - isNuclear that can target cities
    - track research gen per player
    - removing dynamic config for now


  - potentially degenerate strategies:
    - using faster bombers to lead fighters until they're out of fuel
    - only make 1 B52 and tons of fighters for infinite fuel
    - defending with TU-16s which draw off fighters
    - building tons of cities before opponent planes can even reach you


  - play test
    - select/launch from multiple airports at once

  - Next:
    - buying/producing planes from factories and assigning to airports
    - cities w/taxes
    - placing buildings at random (cities, factories, airports, labs)
    - additional features:
      - bombers defend themselves
      - fighter/bombers
      - drones that don't return to base
      - carrier planes
        - launch control from plane
        - return to mothership
        - buy them again at airport
      - stealth

  - CPU opponent:
    - UI for selecting AI opponent
    - server state for AI opponent
    - randomized AI plane designs and deployments
    - randomized AI daemon for launching planes

  - better randomized positioning of airports
    - throwing darts


  - additional features:
    - try out rollback netcode


  - maybe features
    - planes have to refit before they can launch again
