  - playtest:
    - if two different planes finish at the same time it can make both of one type
    - defensive bombers maybe not working?
    - need plane stats for selections
    - more expensive planes just take longer to make...
    - B52
      - radio picker for plane-carrying plane


  - UI:
    - Lefthand sidebar stack:
      - building info/purchasing, show your money
      - airbases selected
      - planes/buildings selected
        - (hover to get stats per plane)
        - carrier planes selected (launch vs move)
    - launch control UI for carrier planes
    - building UI
      - factory UI showing production queue
      - research UI showing status and start/pause

  - refactor:
    - selectors are copypastad between server and client
    - getPlaneDesignsByGen should take in game (on both server and client)


  - Algorithms:
    - intercept target for fighters
    - one fighter per bomber (don't target things that are already targeted)
    - better randomized positioning of buildings


  - potentially degenerate strategies:
    - rush down cities --> different loss conditions?
    - using faster bombers to lead fighters until they're out of fuel
    - only make 1 B52 and tons of fighters for infinite fuel
    - defending with TU-16s which draw off fighters
    - building tons of cities before opponent planes can even reach you


  - CPU opponent:
    - UI for selecting AI opponent
    - server state for AI opponent
    - randomized AI plane designs and deployments
    - randomized AI daemon for launching planes


  - additional features:
    - try out rollback netcode


  - maybe features
    - planes have to refit before they can launch again
